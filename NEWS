The simple and easy to use IRC bot is here! RedStone Development Group brings
you Version 1 of RedStone!

Here is a list of features/updates (not extensive) included in this release:

* IPLookup: Lookup information on an IP address
* API: allow hooking to any and every possible command via rchook.
* Pisg: Added a module to automate Pisg and log with a recognized format.
* API::Socket - Exposing sockets to the API allowing custom sockets/parsers in modules.
* BotStats: Changed command to match module name and added support for API::Socket.
* Sandboxing Eval and Modules
* QDB: Majority rewrite. New features. See module for details.
* OnJoin: Added a configurable HelloChan replacement.
* Replay: Added a module to replay channel history.
* Twitter: A twitter feed announcer.
* Factoids: Added INFO command.
* ABStats: Additonal bot statistics.
* Pisg 1.01: Recheck certain things when rehashed.
* NickPrefix: Extends fantasy support to allow for command execution when the bot is addressed.
* DNS: A module for resolution of DNS hostnames.
* Seen: A seen module, adds the SEEN command.
* Added IPv6 SSL support.
* Made bind optional in server blocks.
* Spotify: New module that adds spotify searching and spotify uri information.
* LastFM: New module that apps last.fm now playing and auto-annoucements of your now playing.
* Autojoin: Added module to manage autojoin from IRC. This will later replace the configuration autojoin.
* Sockets: We now use IO::Async which provides us with various loop methods. This adds the 'loop' option to the configration.
* Auto::HTTP: Exposed Net::Async::HTTP to Auto. This allows for modules to make non-blocking http requests.

Bug fixes:

* var/ permissions error on first run.
* If -c was passed at runtime, also pass it upon restart.
* Rehash: fixed a crash bug when trying to load a module in config that's not already loaded.
* match_user/has_priv: Fixed a bug where only one block can be matched even if a user fits into multiple. This could cause you not to get some privileges.
* module loading: Fixed a bug where mod_load would say a module loaded fine when it really didn't.
* Fixed a bug in API::Socket that'd cause the function to not return upon an error.
* Fixed a bug where Auto wouldn't exit if a non-IRC socket was still running.

We thank you for choosing RedStone.

RedStone Development Group's goal is to create an efficient, stable and highly customizable 
IRC bot in Perl. To offer an alternative to other platforms.
