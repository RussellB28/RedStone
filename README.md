## 1. DESCRIPTION

RedStone IRC Bot is an IRC channel bot that was created in
December of 2009 under the name of Auto. It has siince progressed 
into a bot with an advanced and lightweight module API. 
Many of its features are modules and can be loaded/unloaded to your wish.

Using the module API, you can also write your own modules to
further extend your copy.  If you think your module is useful
and should be included in the mainline program, you can
contact us and request that your module be added to
contributed modules. There is a chance that it will be accepted.
