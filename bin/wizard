Successfully installed to "$cwd/$installdir"!

I've also created an example.conf for you and left it in etc/, configure it and
rename it to auto.conf or any name of your choice.

See the Xelhua Wiki at http://wiki.xelhua.org for complete documentation.

After that, change directory to "$cwd/$installdir" and run `$Bin/auto` (or if
"$Bin" is in your PATH; just `auto`).

If you gave your config file a name other than auto.conf, pass -c=FILENAME to
`auto`, like so, if your config is etc/foo.conf: $Bin/auto -c=foo.conf

Enjoy.
